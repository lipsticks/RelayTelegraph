# RelayTelegraph

## Introduction

This is supposed to become a little plugin for the [BabasChess](http://www.babaschess.net "BabasChess Home") client to be run on [FICS](http://www.freechess.org "The Free Internet Chess Server"). Its foremost purpose being to move the interaction with the **relay bot** away from the console and into the Info Window.

### Prerequisites

The makefiles ware written under the assumption of a working [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org "Minimalist GNU for Windows") environment in place.

### Updates

#### 2013-02-18

I've added a simple test tab to the InfoWindow now. It should draw a little interactive box.

**Note**: If the new tab doesn't show, you will want to enable it. Right click the InfoWindow and open its preferences where you must put a tick next to the "RelayTelegraph".
