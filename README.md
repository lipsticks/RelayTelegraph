RelayTelegraph
==============

This is supposed to become a little plugin for the [BabasChess](http://www.babaschess.net "BabasChess Home") client to be run on [FICS](http://www.freechess.org "The Free Internet Chess Server"). Its sole purpose is to move the interaction with the relay bot away from the console and into the Info Window.
